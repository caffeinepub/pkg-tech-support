  "summary": "The diff shows a comprehensive redesign of LoginPrompt.tsx that implements most of the required features. REQ-24 through REQ-29 are largely addressed. However, one testimonial quote has a minor deviation from the exact specified text, and the diff is truncated so some details cannot be fully verified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Testimonials section must include the verbatim quote 'Laptop running smooth again'",
      "reason": "The diff shows the second testimonial quote as 'Laptop running smooth again — couldn't believe how fast the fix was!' which is not verbatim. The AC requires the quote 'Laptop running smooth again' to be present verbatim.",

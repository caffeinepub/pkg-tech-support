  "summary": "The diff addresses all four requirements. REQ-17 and REQ-18 are handled by rewriting ChatSection.tsx to use useGetChatMessages(ticketId) and useSendMessageForTicket. REQ-19 is handled by removing payment gate logic from ClientPortal.tsx and TicketCreationForm.tsx. REQ-20 is addressed in backend/main.mo though the diff is truncated limiting full verification. The TicketCreationForm collects title/description/priority but the mutationFn only passes techPrincipal to createSupportTicket, potentially disconnecting form fields from the actual backend call.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Submitting the ticket creation form successfully creates a ticket in the backend with the user-entered title, description, and priority.",
      "reason": "In TicketCreationForm.tsx, the mutation calls actor.createSupportTicket(techPrincipal) without passing the collected title, description, or priority fields, meaning user-entered form data is not submitted to the backend.",

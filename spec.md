## Summary
**Goal:** Update the LoginPrompt (landing page) of Caffeine Tech Support to reflect an everyday device support focus with refreshed copy, skills, pricing, testimonials, visuals, and portfolio sections.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the hero headline to "Tech Support Expert | Fast Fixes for Laptops, Desktops, Mobiles & Printers | 10+ Years Experience" and replace the existing description with the short Jaipur-based pro copy
- Add a Skills/Services section listing four bullet points: Laptop/Desktop troubleshooting & upgrades, Mobile repair/setup (Android/iOS), Printer connectivity & ink issues, Remote support via chat/video
- Add a Pricing section with three INR tiers (Basic Diagnostic ₹500, Full Laptop/Mobile Fix ₹1,500, Printer Setup ₹800), each noting a 24–48 hour turnaround
- Add a Testimonials section with at least three styled testimonial cards including the specified quotes and placeholder attributions
- Add a device icons strip (laptop, phone, printer) and a "Device Fixes Done Right" banner using generated images from frontend/public/assets/generated
- Add a Portfolio/Work Samples section with three image cards (printer setup before/after, mobile repair demo, laptop fix demo) with short captions, images loaded from frontend/public/assets/generated

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the landing page see an updated expert profile focused on device support, with clear pricing, skills, testimonials, device icons, a banner, and a portfolio of fix scenarios.
